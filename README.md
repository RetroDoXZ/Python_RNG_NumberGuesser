# Python_RNG_NumberGuesser
I made a simple NumberGuesser as a school project, i spent some extra time on making it a .exe file and that its gui is almost identical to the text reverser. This makes it into a "set"

This program opens in fullscreen, and it has a gui.

when your correctly guessed the number you can use the try again button. while typing numbers into the text box you can press enter instead of the button "gjett" if you want ;]
